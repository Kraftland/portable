# X11 access within sandbox

---

Configuration options:

	- waylandOnly
		- Default: adaptive
		- Possible values: false, true, adaptive
		- Description: Accepts boolean value "true" "false", and a special value "adaptive". While true, Portable hides XAuthority and X11/XIM sockets under `/tmp` from the sandbox, thus disallows X11 connection being made in controlled environments, i.e. X access control is turned on.

---

X11 is considered unsafe and legacy for Portable. It is advised to leave configuration option `waylandOnly` as `adaptive`, of which allows X11 only on pure X environment.

Be advised: Portable unshares the IPC namespace with sandbox, which implies that X11 shared memory extension will not work, indicating (in theory) a performance impact for X windows.
